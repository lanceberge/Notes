* Introduction
** General Advice

- Don't listen to professionals
- Ignore hot tips, recommendations from brokerages, etc.
- Don't invest in what you don't understand
- The price of the stock is its least important measure
- Know where future growth is coming from
- You don't need to make money on every stock you pick: a few big winners offset a few losers
- "Stocks are most likely to be accepted as prudent at the moment they're not"
  - Optimism is highest when stocks are about to crash and lowest when they're about to rebound

** Market cap and P/E ratio

- Market cap :: shares outstanding $\times$ stock price
  - Invest in a company aiming for its market cap to rise (a tenbagger has 10x increase in its market cap)

** Notes on "internet" stocks

- To safely buy in:
  - buy companies that indirectly benefit from the web
  - "free internet play" :: companies with real earnings and reasonable stock prices with internet ventures
  - buy companies that can use the internet to cut costs/ streamline operations

** Definitions

- Shares Outstanding :: The number of shares owned (restricted and unrestricted)
- P/E Ratio          :: a 500 P/E ratio means at current earnings, a company needs 5 centuries to make back the investment
- Float              :: shares owned by investors (unrestricted only)
- Market Corrections :: Declines of 10% or more (ever couple of years)
- Bear markets       :: Declines of 20% or more (every 6 years)

** Why the average investor has an advantage over experts

- As a customer, you know which new developments can be big winners based on what you'd buy

** Taxes

- Dividends are taxed as unearned income, in addition to corporate profits being taxed
- Long-term capital gains are taxed at half the rate of ordinary income taxes

** Preparing to Invest

- Stocks fluctuate an 50% in an average year - a $50 stock will likely hit $60 and $40 in that year
- Ignore gut feelings
- Stand by stocks as long as the fundamentals haven't changed

* Picking Winners

- If you're buying a company for some specific venture, make sure you know the fraction of the company that venture is
  - Ex. don't buy PG for pampers unless you know what percentage of their revenue is from pampers
- Big stocks move less, thus should be long term holds

** Six Categories of Companies

- Slow Growers :: Usually large and old companies, typically pay generous and regular dividends
- Stalwarts    :: 10-12% annual growth, large companies; keep a few in the portfolio to be recession proof
- Fast Growers :: Agressive new enterprises, 20-25% annual growth
               :: Good when they're not in fast-growing industries
               :: Look for new companies with good balance sheets and profits, then sell when they stop growing
- Cyclicals    :: Rise and fall regularly
               :: Flourish at the end of recessions
- Turnarounds  :: Beaten down, typically prosper as the overall market does
               :: benefit from government bailouts
               :: restructuring; i.e. getting rid of some diworeseification
               :: good companies but bankrupt
- Asset Plays  :: Sitting on something valuable that you know but Wall Street has overlooked

- To determine which category a stock fits in make sure you understand the basic business
  - The simpler the better usually

** Signs of a Good Stock

- Good fundamentals regardless of how the stock is currently doing
- Out of favor/overlooked by traditional fund managers - sounds dull or ridiculous
- They do something dull/disagreeable/depressing
- Spinoffs of companies
- No institutional ownership or analysts following it
- Nongrowth industry with little competition
- A niche - i.e. drug companies, newspapers, chemical companies
  - public confidence in it - i.e. tylenol
  - Patents/government authorization provides a niche because only companies with that authorization can do what they do
- People have to repeatedly purchase it
- They benefit from technology
- Insiders are buying - Employees and executives in the company are heavy owners
  - This means shareholders become the priority to the business rather than salaries
  - Sources: Vicker's weekly insider report, the insiders, barron's, WSJ, investor daily
  - Insider selling isn't necessarily a bad sign
- The company is buying back shares
- They don't have to rely on spending to make profits (cash in doesn't depend entirely on cash out)
- They can set the price at whatever they want and retain customers

** Stocks to Avoid

- The current hottest stock in the hottest industry; the one with the most favorable publicity
- Ones with too much competition or where competition could easily begin to exist
- The next /amazon, disney, etc./
- Diworseification :: companies that spend their money in random acquisitions instead of buying back shares or raising dividends
  - It's usually not worse if the company establishes the success of each of its ventures before pursuing another
  - Diversifying companies are fine if their holdings have synergy (a restaurant company should acquire restaurants, not airlines)
    - Share buybacks with cash are still better
- The whisper stock
  - Wait for earnings for these companies
- Companies with most of their earnings from a single customer (middlemen)
- Stocks with exciting names
- Companies with very nice headquarters
- They dilute earnings by issuing new shares

** Earnings

- A quick way to tell if a stock is overpriced is to compare the price line with the earnings line
  - Buy when the price is well below earnings and sell when it's well above

- Future earnings come from: Reduced costs, raised prices, expanding into new markets, selling more product in the old markets, or refactor/close a losing operation

*** P/E Ratio

- The number of years it will take the company to earn back the amount of your investment assuming earnings stay constant

** Dividends

- Stocks that don't pay dividends tend to spend the money on /diworseification/
- Stocks that do tend to be less volatile

** 2 Minute Monologue

- Reasons you're interested in it, what has to happen for it to succeed, pitfalls in its path

** Hidden Assets

- Def :: Assets not listed on the balance sheet
  - i.e. patents, tax breaks
  - Parent companies typically have lots of hidden assets

** The Final Checklist
*** General

- P/E ratio, trailing P/E, how it compares to the industry
- Institutional ownership :: lower = better
- If insiders are buying
- Is the company buying back shares :: Shares outstanding are decreasing
- The record of earnings growth; are they consistent or not (may not be important for an asset play)
- Balance sheet (debt-equity ratio)
- Net cash per share - essentially the stocks floor

*** Slow Growers

- Dividends :: Have they consistently been raised, have they always been paid
  - What percentage of earnings are being paid as dividends - a low percentage is a cushion in hard times

*** Stalwarts

- Big and unlikely to go out of business
- P/E ratio for price
- Check for diworseifications
- Long-term growth rate and if it has kept up previous momentum
- Check how it did in previous recessions and market drops

*** Cyclicals

- Watch inventories and supply-demand relationship
  - Look for new entrants/developments in the market (usually bad)

*** Fast Growers

- Investigate the fraction of the business that comes from whatever new product is supposed to make it a fast grower
- Growth rate in earnings in recent years (20-25% range ideal, 50% typically signifies that it's in a "hot" industry)
- That the company still has room to grow
- If it's selling at p/e ratio or near the growth rate
- If expansion is speeding up or slowing down
- Few institutions own the stock and few analysts have heard of it

*** Turnarounds

- Can the company survive a raid from its creditors
- Cash/debt ratio
- Debt structure and how long it can survive in the red while fixing its problems
- How is the company turning around? :: Getting rid of unprofitable divisions, cutting costs, increasing prices, etc.

*** Asset plays

- What's the value of the assets? Are there hidden assets?
- How much debt is there to detract from these assets
- Is the company taking on new debt, making the assets less valuable?

** Overall

- Understand the nature of companies and the reasons for holding them
- Categorize stocks to get better expectations from them
- Big companies move less than small companies
- Look for companies that have proved their concept can be replicated and are already profitable
- Avoid 50-100% growth rates (per year)
- Avoid hot stocks in hot industries
- Distrust diverseifications
- Invest in simple, dull companies
- Invest in moderate growers (20-25%) in nongrowth industries
- Look for companies with niches
- Seek When buying turnarounds/depressed stocks, find ones with good financial positions and little debt
- Follow a story line for a company
- Trust companies with high personal investment from management (insider ownership)
- Insider buying is a good thing, especially when several insiders buy at once

* The Long-Term View
** Designing a Portfolio

- Sticking to a strategy is the best way to maximize long-term gains
- It's best to own as many stocks as there are situations where:
  - You've got an edge
  - Discovered a prospect that passes all tests of research
- The more stocks you own the more likely you find a tenbagger
- The more stocks you own the more flexibility you have to rotate funds between them
  - e.g. replace a stalwart with another, or just sell some of it
- Lynch owns half of his assets in 100 stocks, two thirds in 200, and the rest in 500 (essentially in 3 ranks)
- Find opportunities in turnarounds/fast growth companies
- If something bolsters his confidence he promotes it
- Balance stocks of the different categories:
- Don't buy overpriced stocks
- Stay invested in stocks long-term, and rotate stocks based on the fundamental situations
- Avoid hearing opinions on stocks that lead to bias

| Category     | sell when...                                                                                                                                        |
|--------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Slow Growers | the fundamentals have deteriorated or 30-50% gain (lost market share, no new R&D), diworseifications (or announcements of further), bad cash-debt   |
| Stalwarts    | p/e strays too far from trailing or industry average, price goes above earnings line, new products with mixed results & little future endeavors,  |
|              | p/e strays too far from trailing or industry average, price goes above earnings line, new products with mixed results & little future endeavors,  |
|              | no insiders bought shares in the last year, a major division is slumping, the growth rate is slowing                                              |
| Asset plays  | once someone shows up and makes it apparent that there are assets - i.e. a top investor                                                           |
|              | they issue more shares to finance diversification, institutional ownership rises too high                                                         |
| Cyclicals    | end of the cycle, when something has started to go wrong (raising costs), your reason for buying has ended, inventories are building up           |
|              | falling commodity prices, building new plants instead of modernizing old plants for cheap                                                         |
| Turnarounds  | after it's turned around, debt is rising quite a bit, inventory is rising, inflated p/e relative to earnings growth, sells mostly to one customer |
| Fast growth  | at the end of the second phase of rapid growth, if it's high rated by Wall Street analysts, p/e ratio surpasses projected earnings growth         |

- For fast growers, cyclicals, and turnarounds:
  - Keep as long as earnings are growing and expansion is continuing (check the story every few months as if you were hearing it for the first time)
  - Replace with new fast-growers if the price is way up and the story starts to sound dubious
    - The fast-grower you replace it with should have a declined or stagnant price with a better story
- Never sell unless the fundamentals/story change
- Load up during price drops
  - Abolish the idea of selling during price drops
- Market usually drops October-December
  - TODO stock up cash for the end of the year

** The Most Dangerous Things People Say About a Stock

- It can't go lower than this
- You can always tell when it's hit rock bottom
  - Don't buy a stock just because it's gone down far
- It can't go higher than this
  - If the story and fundamentals are good and it isn't overpriced - it can and probably will
- Eventually they always come back
- When it goes to $10, I'll sell
          - Sell when you wouldn't buy more of the company
- It's taking too long for anything to happen - this is actually favorable

** Summary of this Section

- Buy during market declines
- You can't predict the direction of the market
- Compounding 20-30% gains in stalwarts is quite profitable
- Long-term, stocks catch up to their fundamentals
- Stalwarts with heavy institutional ownership and much Wall Street coverage and are overpriced will decline
- Don't buy mediocre stocks because they're cheap
- Don't sell outstanding fast growers because they seem overpriced
- Continually monitor the story of a stock
- Prune and rotate stocks based on fundamentals - when stocks are out of line with reality, swap them for better alternatives
- Add/subtract to your bets in stocks when they seem favorable/unfavorable

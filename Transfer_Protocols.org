#+title: Transfer Protocols
* HTTP
* TCP

- All packets are guaranteed to be received in order using a handshake
  | Checksum fields and sequence numbers for each packet

- If the checksum fails, data will need to be resent
- Web servers can keep many connections open, but you'll want connection pooling if
    you have too many connections with a server

* UDP

- UDP has no checksum, enabling lower latency
- Packets are not guaranteed to be received in order
- This is best for live games, video chat, video streaming

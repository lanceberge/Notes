* Message Queues

- If an operation is slow synchronously, you can use a message queue to send requests to a consumer

Consumer

- A server that listens for messages then performs tasks

** Disadvantages

Queuing incurs additional delays, which might not be worth it if the operation can be performed
  quickly in serial

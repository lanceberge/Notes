* Code smells

Rigidity   -  The software is difficult to change -  A small change causes a cascade of subsequent changes
Fragility  -  The software breaks in many places due to a single change
Immobility -  You cannot reuse parts of the code in other projects because of involved risks and high effort
Opacity    -  The code is hard to understand
Needless Complexity
Needless Repetition

* Style

  - Put the caller above the callee

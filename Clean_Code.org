* Code smells

- Rigidity   -  The software is difficult to change -  A small change causes a cascade of subsequent changes
- Fragility  -  The software breaks in many places due to a single change
- Immobility -  You cannot reuse parts of the code in other projects because of involved risks and high effort
- Opacity    -  The code is hard to understand
- Needless Complexity
- Needless Repetition

* Style

  - Put the caller above the callee

* Law of Demeter

  - Modules shouldn't know about the internals of the classes they use

* Procedural vs. OOP

  Procedural - a class ex. =DBHandler= that operates on a data structurel

  - This can be favorable for data structures that aren't meant to be modified

  OOP - Is better for evolving data types

* Static Site Generation

  - The whole site will be generated all at once
  - Then you can save it on the CDN
  - But this is bad if the site changes a lot

* SSR

  - The pages are rendered by the server only when you need to render them
  - You can then save it on the CDN

* CDN

  - Save the pages and distribute them across the world
